# Pipeline to Server deployment by Kohilan KH
Git actions are very powerful and they help us to automate our workflow. We can use them to trigger our pipeline and to deploy our code to the server. In my opinion, git actions are the best way to automate our workflow.

The first thing we need to do is to create a .yml file in our repository. This file will contain all the instructions for our pipeline. We can specify the name of our pipeline, the trigger, the actions, and the environment variables in this file.

The name of our pipeline should be unique. The trigger can be either push or pull request. The actions are the tasks that need to be performed by our pipeline. We can specify the environment variables in the environment section.

The next thing we need to do is to specify the steps in our pipeline. We can use the “jobs” keyword to specify the steps. Each job can have multiple steps. We need to specify the name of the job, the steps, and the environment variables in each job.

The name of the job should be unique. The steps are the tasks that need to be performed by the job. We can specify the environment variables in the environment section.

The last thing we need to do is to specify the “workflow” keyword. The workflow is the sequence of jobs that need to be executed. We need to specify the name of the workflow, the jobs, and the environment variables in the workflow.

The name of the workflow should be unique. The jobs are the tasks that need to be executed by the workflow. We can specify the environment variables in the environment section.

After we have specified the name of our pipeline, the trigger, the actions, and the environment variables, we need to push our code to the repository. This will trigger our pipeline and the code will be deployed to the server.
